(ns cloudflare-email-verify
  "Complete a Cloudflare Email Routing *destination verification* via computer
  use: drive the frontmost (already-logged-in) browser to the one-time verify
  URL Cloudflare emails to a new forwarding address, click 'Verify email
  address', and CONFIRM the result programmatically through the Cloudflare API.

  Why a computer-use agent and not just curl: the verify link
  (dash.cloudflare.com/email_fwdr/verify?token=…) is consumed by the
  authenticated dashboard SPA — a headless GET returns 403. The token proves
  mailbox control; the *click* must happen inside the operator's logged-in
  browser session. This agent does exactly that one click, nothing else.

  Runs on a LOCAL model by default — Ollama serving gemma 4 QAT (see jvm-host),
  so nothing leaves the machine. Model backend: LLM=ollama|gemini|anthropic.

     clojure -M:dev:examples -e \\
       \"(require 'cloudflare-email-verify) (cloudflare-email-verify/-main)\"

  Env:
    CF_VERIFY_URL     the verify link from the Cloudflare email (required;
                      may also be passed as the first CLI arg)
    CF_TARGET_EMAIL   destination being verified, for the API re-check
                      (default jun784@gmail.com)
    CF_ACCOUNT_ID     Cloudflare account id (enables the check_verified tool)
    CF_TOKEN_ITEM     1Password item holding a CF API token (default
                      \"gftd.cloudflare/API_TOKEN\")
    CF_TOKEN_FIELD    field in that item (default \"password\")
    CF_TOKEN_VAULT    optional 1Password vault name
    VAULT             op | bw   (default op; must be signed in)

  SCOPE: this is a NARROW, near-read-only task. The agent navigates to ONE URL,
  clicks ONE 'Verify email address' button, and confirms. It must not touch any
  other account setting (no rules, no DNS, no destinations) — the system prompt
  forbids it and there is no tool to do so."
