(ns gmail-read
  "Read recent Gmail for the operator via a computer-use-clj agent.

  Unlike the other examples this agent does NOT drive the desktop — it
  uses the `fetch_mail` tool (computeruse.mail), which retrieves INBOX
  over IMAP with the operator's Gmail app password. Why not screen-drive
  the browser: ADR-0009 forbids the agent from performing Google password
  sign-in (even via computer-use / 1Password), and an app password is a
  non-interactive IMAP credential, not a browser sign-in. The password
  lives in the kagi vault (computeruse.vault/kagi-vault) and is resolved
  inside the tool's :fn — it never reaches the model, the message
  history, or the Datomic action log.

  `:computer` is a mock (the loop requires one, but the system prompt
  forbids screen actions); the only tool that does I/O is `fetch_mail`.

  Runs on a LOCAL model by default — Ollama serving gemma 4 QAT (see
  jvm-host), so mail content stays on the machine.

     clojure -M:dev:examples -e \\
       \"(require 'gmail-read) (gmail-read/-main)\"

  Env:
    GMAIL_ACCOUNT             (required) the Gmail address to read
    GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD_ITEM   kagi item holding the app password
                              (default gmail-app-password)
    GMAIL_MAILBOX             (default INBOX)
    GMAIL_SEARCH              IMAP search criteria (default UNSEEN; ALL to list all)
    GMAIL_LIMIT               (default 10)
    VAULT                     kagi | op | bw   (default kagi; must be unlocked)

  Prereqs (one-time, in the Google account):
    - 2-Step Verification ON; an App Password generated.
    - Gmail Settings → Forwarding and POP/IMAP → IMAP access: ENABLED.
    - `kagi add gmail-app-password -c mail` (stdin) to store the app password."
