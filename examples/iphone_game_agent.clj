  "An LLM plays a game on a *physical* iPhone, seen through iPhone Mirroring.

     clojure -M:dev:gemma -e \"(require 'iphone-game-agent) (iphone-game-agent/-main \\\"Solitaire\\\")\"

  Prereqs, all of which fail loudly rather than quietly:
    • macOS 15+, iPhone Mirroring open and connected (phone locked, nearby)
    • cliclick on PATH (`brew install cliclick`)
    • Screen Recording + Accessibility permission for this terminal

  This is the *unevolved* path: the model looks at each frame and decides the
  next action. It is the counterpart of `kotoba-lang/loop-game-autoplay`, which
  evolves a linear policy over 12 numbers of game state — that one is faster
  and cannot see, this one is slower and can. Neither subsumes the other.

  Every step is a datom (`:caction/*`), so a finished run answers \"what did it
  actually tap, and in what order\" without a screen recording."
