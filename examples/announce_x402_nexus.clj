  Owner instruction (2026-07-10): no Anthropic API, gftdcojp/cloud-murakumo
  only. Defaults to LLM=murakumo (jvm-host/make-model \"murakumo\") --
  murakumo.cloud's OpenAI-compatible gateway, no API key needed. No
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is read anywhere in this file.

  IMPORTANT CAVEAT, not fixed here (see jvm_host.clj's make-model
  docstring for the full finding): murakumo's currently-served model has
  no vision support (rejects image_url content with a missing-mmproj
  error), and this whole task is screenshot-driven -- so running this
  against the murakumo default will very likely stall out and call `done`
  success=false the first time the agent needs to actually see the
  screen, not because the wiring is wrong but because there is currently
  no vision-capable model behind murakumo.cloud/api/v1/chat/completions.
  This will start working automatically once murakumo's fleet serves a
  vision-capable model at that same OpenAI-compatible endpoint -- no
  change needed here when that happens. Override with e.g.
  `LLM=ollama OLLAMA_MODEL=<a vision-capable local model>` in the
  meantime if you need this to actually run before then.

  Content is embedded from `kotoba-lang/x402-directory/docs/announcements.md`
  (2026-07-10 drafts) — not fetched live, so what actually gets typed is
  reviewable in this file, not whatever that doc happens to say by the time
  this runs. If the drafts change, update both.

  HARD RULE — never actually publishes: every task below ends with
  'fill the form exactly as given, screenshot it, then call done — do NOT
  click Submit/Post/Continue'. The agent's job is to get a fully-filled,
  screenshotted form in front of a human; the actual publish click is a
  human action every time, on every platform, no exceptions. This mirrors
  every other financial/public-facing effect in this monorepo (cloud-
  itonami's business-governor, nexus-x402's :destructive-risk proposals):
  an agent proposes/prepares, a human executes the irreversible step.

  Assumes the frontmost/target browser session is ALREADY logged in to
  the target platform (HN, Reddit, or the Base community's Discord/forum)
  — this script does not attempt any login flow. If a login/auth page
  appears instead of the expected form, the agent is instructed to stop
  with success=false rather than guess at credentials it doesn't have."
