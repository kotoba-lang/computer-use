  "Add an IP to a Vultr API key's Access Control list via computer use,
  with vault-backed login — the agent NEVER types a raw credential.

  Credentials come from a vault (1Password by default; set VAULT=bw for
  Bitwarden). The agent fills the login form with the `type_secret`
  action, which resolves the secret at the host/vault layer and types
  it without it ever reaching the model, the message history, or the
  Datomic action log. No secret is ever passed as raw text.

  Vault item is configured by env:
    VULTR_VAULT_ITEM   (default \"Vultr\")
    VULTR_VAULT        1Password vault name (optional)
  op must be signed in (`op signin`) / bw unlocked (`BW_SESSION=$(bw unlock --raw)`)."
