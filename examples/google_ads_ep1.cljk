  "Create a YouTube (Google Ads) Video-views campaign for SHIRO & PICO EP1, per
  language, by driving the frontmost browser via computer use. Runs against the
  strong vision model at llm.gftd.ai (OpenAI-compatible, Claude Sonnet 4.6).

  SAFETY: the agent CONFIGURES the campaign (budget ¥3,000, video, language +
  geo targeting, ad) but DOES NOT click the final 'Publish/Create campaign'
  button — it stops at the review screen and calls `done`. The human makes the
  spend-commit click. Budget is capped at ¥3,000/campaign regardless.
