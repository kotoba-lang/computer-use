  "Inspect a Cloudflare Worker's DEPLOYMENT state from the dash via computer
  use — the read-only answer to \"why does the live `etzhayyim-did-web`
  worker stay pinned to an old version even though `wrangler deploy` +
  `wrangler versions deploy @100%` report SUCCESS?\" (the blocker that
  stalled ADR-2606272300 Step 2).

  `wrangler` reported a confusing/contradictory picture (active version
  unchanged across deploys; gradual-deployment lines), so this drives the
  ACTUAL Cloudflare dashboard and READS the ground truth:
    - the worker's ACTIVE deployment (version id + date + SOURCE:
      Upload / Workers Builds (git) / Version),
    - whether **Workers Builds** (a connected GitHub repo) owns the
      active-version pointer (→ activation = merge → CI build, not manual
      `wrangler deploy`),
    - the recent deployment / version history,
    - HOW to advance the active version (the dash control: Deploy /
      Promote / gradual-deployment %),
  and persists the findings as EDN via the `save_findings` tool.

  READ-ONLY by default — the agent navigates + reads + screenshots, and
  NEVER deploys/promotes/edits/deletes/rolls-back. A separate, explicitly
  opted-in PROMOTE mode (CF_PROMOTE=1, or `-main \"promote\"`) lets it
  click the single \"Deploy / Promote latest version to 100%\" control and
  nothing else — for advancing the active version to a freshly-merged
  build once the human authorizes it.

  Runs on LLM=ollama|gemini|anthropic (see jvm-host). The CF dashboard is
  vision- + reasoning-heavy navigation, so LLM=anthropic is recommended;
  local Ollama gemma-4-QAT also works (tools+vision). Login uses
  `type_secret` (vault ref, never a raw credential); on an unexpected
  2FA/SSO step with no secret_ref the agent bails (done success=false).
