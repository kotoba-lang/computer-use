(ns epo-ops-register
  "Register for EPO Open Patent Services (OPS) — the free 'Non-paying' developer
  tier (3.5 GB/week) — via computer use, to obtain a Consumer Key + Consumer
  Secret for OAuth2. Drives the frontmost browser through developers.epo.org:
  create account → (email confirmation, handled out-of-band) → log in → My Apps
  → Add a new App → read the Consumer Key/Secret and store them in 1Password.

  Runs on a LOCAL model by default — Ollama serving gemma 4 QAT (see jvm-host) —
  so nothing leaves the machine. Model backend: LLM=ollama|gemini|anthropic.

     clojure -M:dev:examples -e \\
       \"(require 'epo-ops-register) (epo-ops-register/-main)\"

  Vault: the account password is typed via `type_secret` (resolved at the host
  from 1Password item `epo.ops/developer-account`, field `password`) — the model
  never sees it. The Consumer Key/Secret the agent READS off the My Apps page are
  written back into that same item by the `save_credentials` tool.

  Two-stage reality: EPO emails a confirmation link mid-registration and may show
  a CAPTCHA. A single agent run cannot click an email link or solve a CAPTCHA —
  on either it calls `done success=false` and you (a) confirm via the email that
  lands in jun784@gmail.com (etzhayyim.com catch-all) / solve the CAPTCHA, then
  (b) re-run; on the second pass the account exists, so the agent logs in and
  creates the app. STAGE=register | createapp selects which half to run.
