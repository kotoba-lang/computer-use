(ns sumitclub-meisai
  "Fetch カード利用明細 from SuMi TRUST CLUB (sumitclub.jp) via computer
  use, with vault-backed login — the agent NEVER types a raw credential
  and NEVER changes anything on the account (read-only scope).

  Runs on a LOCAL model by default — Ollama serving gemma 4 QAT
  (tools + vision capable), so statement data never leaves the machine:

     clojure -M:dev:examples -e \"(require 'sumitclub-meisai) (sumitclub-meisai/-main)\"

  Model backend is selected by LLM=ollama|gemini|anthropic (see
  jvm-host): gemini uses Gemini's OpenAI-compatible endpoint with
  GEMINI_API_KEY; OLLAMA_MODEL / GEMINI_MODEL override the defaults.

  The agent drives an already-open browser to the 利用明細照会 page,
  logs in through `type_secret` (the secret is resolved at the
  host/vault layer and never reaches the model, the message history, or
  the Datomic action log), reads the statement table, and persists the
  rows through the `save_statement` tool as EDN — ready for downstream
  ingestion (e.g. an etzhayyim actor normalizing into kotoba EAVT).

  Env:
    SUMITCLUB_VAULT_ITEM   vault item name      (default \"sumitclub\")
    SUMITCLUB_VAULT        1Password vault name (optional)
