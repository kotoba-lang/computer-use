  "Interpretation adapters for the resident bot layer (ADR-0003).

  An adapter is a plain function

      (fn [{:keys [prompt image-path]}]
        → {:text \"…\" :tokens n :adapter :kw :raw {…}}
        | {:error \"…\" :adapter :kw})

  — text in, text out, with an optional screenshot. That is the whole
  seam. It is deliberately NOT langchain's ChatModel protocol: the
  resident CLI has to load under nbb from a bare checkout, where the
  langgraph/langchain git deps are not resolvable. computeruse.agent
  and computeruse.openai-model keep the ChatModel seam for the JVM
  tool-calling loop; this namespace is the seam the resident loop uses.
  computeruse.bots/backend->computer bridges the two.

  All I/O goes through the injected sh seam (curl / the claude CLI), so
  no HTTP client is needed on either host.

  MEASURED 2026-08-29 — both adapters were proved to actually read an
  image, not merely to accept one:
    :claude-cli   described a Japanese conversation about bread storage
                  that is visible only inside the screenshot (9.3s,
                  exit 0, permission_denials empty)
    :murakumo     answered \"the ChatGPT desktop application window\"
                  for a capture of the ChatGPT window (64s)
  Neither answer is derivable from the prompt or the file name."
