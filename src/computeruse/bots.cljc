  "The multi-bot resident layer (ADR-0003).

  A roster is a vector of bot entries. One bot = one session = one
  backend + one goal + one deterministic gate + one receipt. The gate
  runs BEFORE every act!, and a refusal is RECORDED with its reason
  literal — never dropped, never retried silently. Negative tests pin
  the literal, because a test that asserts only that something failed
  cannot tell a gate refusal apart from a crash.

  Validation is fail-closed, mirroring cloud-itonami's grok_bot_runtime
  normalize-config discipline: an entry that does not typecheck is a
  problem with a named reason, and a roster with any problem is
  :could-not-measure — never \"zero bots are due\".

  Three-valued outcome, kept three-valued all the way to the CLI's exit
  code:
    :done               the session ran and finished
    :failed             the session ran and did not reach its goal
    :could-not-measure  the session could not be run at all"
