  "Real IComputer host capability for macOS (JVM only).

  Shells out to the OS toolchain:

    screenshot        screencapture -x  → sips resize → Anthropic image block
    key / type        osascript (System Events keystroke / key code)
    mouse / click     cliclick  (https://github.com/BluM/cliclick, `brew install cliclick`)
    cursor position   cliclick p

  Coordinate model: the model sees screenshots resized to :model-width
  (default 1280) pixels; incoming click coordinates are scaled back to
  display points before dispatch, so the agent can click what it sees.

  Permissions: the calling terminal needs macOS Screen Recording (for
  screencapture) and Accessibility (for cliclick / System Events).

  This namespace deliberately implements no credential handling — an
  agent run on top of it must never type secrets (see
  examples/vultr_ip_allow.clj for the guardrail prompt)."
