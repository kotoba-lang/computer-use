  "Selectable execution-backend contract (ADR-0003).

  A backend is one way to *observe* an environment and *act* on it,
  chosen per bot/session from a fixed registry of ten ids
  (resources/computeruse/backends.edn). The contract is deliberately
  smaller than IComputer: one observation form, one action form, and a
  measured availability probe — so backends that cannot support the
  full Anthropic action vocabulary (a window-scoped capture, a headless
  gate command) are still selectable through the same seam.

    observe! → frame map    {:png-path .. :captured-at .. :backend ..}
                            (or a non-visual observation map, or a
                            refusal map)
    act!     → result       deny-by-default: an action kind the backend
                            does not support returns an explicit
                            refusal value, never a silent no-op
    probe!   → availability {:available? true|false|:unmeasured
                             :why .. :measured-at ..}

  Refusal values are maps {:refused true :reason <pinned literal>}.
  The reason literals below are part of the contract — negative tests
  pin them. A test that asserts only \"it failed\" cannot tell a refusal
  apart from a crash, which is the failure mode this workspace calls
  out (ADR-2608136000): assert the reason."
