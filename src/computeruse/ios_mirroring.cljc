  "IComputer over a *physical* iPhone, seen through macOS **iPhone Mirroring**.

  The sibling of `computeruse.android`. Android has `adb`, which talks to the
  device directly: `screencap` returns the framebuffer and `input tap` injects
  a real touch. iOS has no such channel here — Appium / WebDriverAgent /
  XCUITest are not present in this workspace, and `simctl` (simulator only)
  has no `tap`. What macOS 15+ does give is a **window** that shows the live
  phone screen and forwards pointer and keyboard events to it.

  So this driver is entirely made of things that already worked:

    screenshot   screencapture -R <window rect> → sips resize → image block
    tap          cliclick c:  inside the window
    swipe        cliclick dd/dm/du along an interpolated path
    text / keys  osascript System Events, with iPhone Mirroring frontmost

  ## Coordinate model

  Same shape as `computeruse.android`: the model sees the window contents
  scaled to `:model-width` pixels and answers in that space. Two corrections
  separate this from the Android case, and both are silent when wrong:

  1. **Origin.** The capture is a *crop*, so a model coordinate maps to
     `content-origin + model * scale`, not to `model * scale`. Drop the origin
     and every tap is off by the window's position on the desktop — plausible
     taps, consistently wrong.
  2. **Points, not pixels.** `screencapture -R` takes points and, on a Retina
     display, writes a PNG at 2× those points. The scale factor is therefore
     `content size in POINTS / model width in PIXELS`. Computing it from the
     captured pixel dimensions is off by exactly the backing scale factor —
     which reads as \"taps land in the top-left quadrant\".

  `model->screen` is a pure function and is tested against both.

  ## What this cannot do

  - **Multitouch.** A mouse is one pointer. Pinch, rotate, and two-finger
    gestures have no expression here. A game that requires them is out of
    reach for this driver, not merely slow.
  - **Frame-accurate timing.** iPhone Mirroring is a live video stream over
    the local network. Observation lags the device by tens of milliseconds and
    drops frames under load, so a policy that must react within one frame will
    not do so reliably. Turn-based and slow real-time games are the honest
    target.
  - **Running while the phone is in use.** iPhone Mirroring requires the
    iPhone to be locked and nearby; picking the phone up ends the session.

  ## Prereqs

  - macOS 15+ with iPhone Mirroring set up and connected, window open
  - `cliclick` (`brew install cliclick`)
  - Screen Recording permission (screencapture) and Accessibility permission
    (cliclick / System Events) for the calling terminal

  Everything above the `#?(:clj)` boundary is pure and runs on any host; only
